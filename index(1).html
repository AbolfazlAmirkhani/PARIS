            <h4>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. 
                Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine.
                Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral,
                 the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
                The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
                 It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
                  Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer", it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.
                The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum is a national art museum in Paris, France.
                 A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement and home to some of the most canonical works of Western art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo.
